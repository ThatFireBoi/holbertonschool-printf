FUNCTIONS

  int _printf(const char *format, ...):
  This function is used to print formatted output to the standard output (usually the console). It accepts a format string as its first argument, which may contain format specifiers. The format specifiers are replaced by the values of the additional arguments provided to the function. The function returns the total number of characters printed or a negative value if an error occurs.

  int _putchar(char c):
  This function writes a single character to the standard output (usually the console). It takes a character as its argument and returns the character written as an unsigned char cast to an int. This function is used internally by _printf to handle individual characters.

  int print_char(char c):
  This function is used to print a single character to the standard output (usually the console). It takes a character as its argument and returns the number of characters printed, which is always 1 for this function.

  int print_string(char *s):
  This function is used to print a null-terminated string to the standard output (usually the console). It takes a pointer to a character array (string) as its argument and returns the number of characters printed.

  int print_integer(int num):
  This function is used to print an integer to the standard output (usually the console). It takes an integer as its argument and returns the number of characters printed.
